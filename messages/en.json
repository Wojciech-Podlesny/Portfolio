    "description": "I’m a Frontend Developer focused on building fast, accessible, and maintainable web applications using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. From the very beginning of my coding journey, I’ve been fascinated by how code directly shapes user experiences. Over time, I’ve learned that great applications are not only about technology — performance, accessibility, usability, and testing are equally important to ensure reliability and long-term quality. I enjoy turning ideas into products, combining clean interfaces with solid backend logic, always keeping the end user in mind. My long-term goal is to grow into a Full-Stack Engineer, so I can deliver features from concept to deployment and contribute to large-scale applications. Outside of coding, I’m passionate about model building — a hobby that teaches me attention to detail and reminds me of the joy of creating.",
